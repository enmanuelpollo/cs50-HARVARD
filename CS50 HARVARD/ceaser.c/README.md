# Caesar Cipher

The Caesar Cipher program implements a simple encryption algorithm that shifts each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. This program allows users to encrypt their messages using a key that specifies the number of positions to shift.

## Introduction

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and simplest encryption techniques. This program enables users to convert plaintext into ciphertext by applying a specified shift (key) to each letter. Non-alphabetical characters remain unchanged.

## Technologies Used

- **C**: The programming language used for this implementation.
- **CS50 Library**: For handling user input and output.

## Installation

To compile and run the program, ensure you have the CS50 library installed. You can compile the program using `clang` as follows:

bash
clang -o caesar caesar.c -lcs50
Replace caesar.c with the name of your source file.

Usage
To use the program, run the following command in your terminal, providing a numerical key as a command-line argument:

bash

./caesar key
The program will prompt you to enter the plaintext to be encrypted. After input, it will display the ciphertext.

Features
Input Validation: Ensures that the key provided is a numeric value.
Shifted Encryption: Each letter in the plaintext is shifted according to the key while preserving case.
Non-alphabetical Character Handling: Non-alphabet characters are output unchanged.
Example
Hereâ€™s an example of how the program works:

bash

$ ./caesar 3
plaintext: HELLO
ciphertext: KHOOR
In this example, the user enters the plaintext "HELLO" with a key of 3. The program outputs the ciphertext "KHOOR".

Functionality
The program works as follows:

It checks for the correct number of command-line arguments and verifies that the key is numeric.
It prompts the user for plaintext input.
It converts the key from a string to an integer.
It loops through each character of the plaintext:
If the character is uppercase, it shifts it by the key, wrapping around the alphabet if necessary.
If the character is lowercase, it shifts it similarly.
Non-alphabetical characters are printed unchanged.
It outputs the resulting ciphertext.
